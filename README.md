# PASSWORD_STRENGTH_DETECTOR
OVERVIEW:
This project gives you a solid password strength checker built into one Python function - no extra tools needed. It works by checking how long the password is while also looking at what kinds of characters are used. Instead of relying on outside packages, it runs on its own. The score depends partly on length, partly on variety like numbers or symbols mixed in.

FEATURES:
Standalone: Works without extra tools or add-ons. Pure Python: relies solely on string tools like isupper or isdigit, also uses any(); nothing extra added. Tiered setup splits passwords into five groups: Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong and Very Strong. Gets specific - tells you exactly what’s missing, like capital letters or symbols, so your password gets tougher. Shows gaps clearly instead of just saying it’s weak. Helps fix flaws step by step without confusion. Makes building strong passwords way easier with clear hints. Grading setup: gives a number score depending on how long it is plus how varied the content seems.

TECHNOLOGIES/TOOLS USED:
Language: Python Development: Github Method used: String manipulation, Functions, Conditional statements

INSTALLATION AND SETUP:
Since this project consists of a single function, installation involves cloning the repository and importing the function into your Python environment. Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run: git clone https://github.com/aarna25mim10050-debug/Password-Strength-Checker.git cd Password-Strength-Checker

INSTRUCTION FOR TESTING:
A comprehensive testing script is included to validate the scoring and feedback for various password combinations.

Run Tests: To execute the test suite (assuming you are using a standard testing framework like pytest or a simple test file named test_checker.py): ->Example if using unittest or a simple execution script python test_checker.py pip install pytest pytest
Expected Test Cases Ensure the following common scenarios yield the correct results: short -> 5 Very Weak mypassword -> 10 Weak MyPass123 -> 9 Moderate SecureP@ss12! -> 13 Strong ExtraLongSecurePassword42@#$ -> 28 Very Strong
